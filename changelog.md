    - Added voice input for the main task field.
    - Sub-tasks (AI-generated or manual) are saved to/loaded from localStorage.
    - **Recursive Breakdown**: Implemented ability to break down any sub-task into further sub-sub-tasks, both manually and using AI. UI updated with indentation and controls for nested tasks. State management refactored to handle tree structure. LocalStorage updated to `TASK_BREAKER_STORAGE_KEY_SUBTASKS_v2` due to structure change.
- **PriorityGrid Tool Enhancements (Phase 1 - UI/UX & Basic Presets)**:
    - Updated `PriorityTask` interface to include optional `frequency`, `specificDate`, `specificTime`.
    - Enhanced the "Add Task" form with inputs for these new properties (Select for frequency, Popover Calendar for date, input type="time" for time).
    - **UI Clarity**:
        - Added asterisk `*` for required fields in "Add Task" and "Edit Task".
        - Implemented collapsible "Options avancées" section for frequency, date, and time in both "Add Task" and "Edit Task" forms to reduce initial clutter.

    - Implemented an "Edit Task" dialog to modify all task properties.
    - Task cards in the grid now display frequency, date, and time if set.
    - All task data, including new properties, is saved to/loaded from `localStorage` (using key `PRIORITY_GRID_STORAGE_KEY_TASKS_v1`).
    - Implemented a functional **Preset System**:
        - "Charger un Preset" button opens a dialog.
        - Dialog lists hardcoded, categorized presets using an Accordion for a tree-like structure.
        - Selecting a preset populates the "Add Task" form, expanding advanced options if needed.
        - Toast notification confirms preset loading.
        - Added more preset categories and items.
- **PriorityGrid Tool Enhancements (Phase 1.5 - Custom Presets)**:
    - Added "Sauvegarder comme Preset" button to save current task form details as a custom preset.
    - Custom presets are named by the user via a dialog.
    - Custom presets are saved to/loaded from `localStorage` (using key `PRIORITY_GRID_CUSTOM_PRESETS_KEY_v1`).
    - Custom presets are displayed in the "Charger un Preset" dialog under a "Mes Presets Personnalisés" category.
- **Database Integration Planning (Phase 0 Started)**:
    - Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` library.
    - Added placeholder `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to `.env`.
    - Added a placeholder "Hors ligne / Online" toggle button to the header (currently non-functional, shows a toast).
    - Detailed plan for IndexedDB and Supabase integration outlined.
- **Database Integration (Phase 0 Continued)**:
    - Removed "Outils (Lampe)" and "Étincelles" navigation buttons from header.
    - Updated `.env` with actual Supabase project URL and anon key.
    - Created `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` to initialize and export the Supabase client.
    - Provided `supabase_schema.sql` for user to set up tables (brain_dumps, routines, routine_steps, task_breaker_tasks, priority_tasks) and RLS policies in their Supabase project.

## To Do

- **Database & Sync Implementation (High Priority)**:
    - **Phase 0 (User Action Required)**:
        - **User to execute `supabase_schema.sql` in their Supabase project SQL Editor to create tables and RLS policies.**
    - **Phase 1: User Authentication (Supabase)**
        - Implement Sign Up, Log In, Log Out UI and logic.
        - Create `AuthContext` for session management (listen to `onAuthStateChange`).
        - Update `MagicHeader` for auth state (show login/logout, user info).
    - **Phase 2: Abstract Data Layer & Services**
        - Define generic data service interface (e.g., `src/services/appDataService.ts`) and specific tool service interfaces (e.g., `IPriorityTaskService`).
        - Implement IndexedDB providers for each tool service (e.g., using `idb` library).
        - Implement Supabase providers for each tool service (queries must use `user_id`).
        - Create combined `appDataService` with dynamic provider switching based on online/offline mode and auth state.
    - **Phase 3: Integrate PriorityGrid with New Data Layer**
        - Refactor `PriorityGridTool` to use `appDataService` instead of `localStorage`.
        - Make "Hors ligne / Online" toggle functional, influencing `appDataService` mode.
    - **Phase 4: Synchronization Logic**
        - Implement logic for tracking local changes (dirty checking or pending sync log in IndexedDB).
        - Implement initial sync (login/switch to online): upload local, download remote, conflict resolution (e.g., last write wins based on `updated_at`).
        - Implement ongoing sync: attempt Supabase write first; if fails, queue locally.
        - Implement offline-to-online sync: process queue, fetch remote changes, resolve conflicts.
        - Ensure all records have UUIDs and `created_at`/`updated_at` timestamps.
    - **Phase 5: Integrate Other Tools** (TaskBreaker, RoutineBuilder, BrainDump) with `appDataService`.
    - **Phase 6: UI Feedback & Error Handling** for sync status, online/offline mode, and errors.
- **PriorityGrid Tool Enhancements (Post-Database)**:
    - Implement a full client-side recurrence engine (managing completion cycles, auto-generating next instances for daily, weekly tasks etc.).
    - Integrate voice input for adding/editing tasks in PriorityGrid.
    - Explore AI assistance for quadrant suggestion based on task text and intensity.
- **TaskBreaker Tool Enhancements**:
    - Consider voice input for adding/editing individual sub-tasks (currently only for main task).
    - Refine UI for very deep nesting if it becomes an issue.
- **RoutineBuilder Tool Enhancements (Phase 2)**:
    - Consider UI for reordering routines and steps.
    - Optional: Add specific time input for routines.
    *   Optional: Interactive execution mode (checking off steps as done for a specific day).
    - Refine voice input for editing existing step text (currently only appends).
- Integrate Genkit AI more deeply into other existing tools (TimeFocus modes) to make the "magic level" (intensity) impact their behavior.
- Implement remaining tools from `tool-grid.tsx` with their specific functionalities and intensity level integrations:
    - DecisionHelper (placeholder page exists)
    - MoodTracker (placeholder page exists)
    - FocusMode (placeholder page exists)
- Flesh out "Étincelles" (Sparks) page content (or remove link if page is not planned).
- Implement actual email sending for contact form.
- Refine UI/UX across all tools, including responsive design, accessibility, loading states, and error handling for new features.
- Add relevant image placeholders with `data-ai-hint` to all newly developed tool pages where appropriate.
- Add tests (unit, integration).
- Review and improve safety settings for Genkit flows.
- **Voice Input**: Refine voice input for BrainDump, Formalizer. Fully implement for new tools where applicable.
