    - Added voice input for the main task field.
    - Sub-tasks (AI-generated or manual) are saved to/loaded from localStorage.
    - **Recursive Breakdown**: Implemented ability to break down any sub-task into further sub-sub-tasks, both manually and using AI. UI updated with indentation and controls for nested tasks. State management refactored to handle tree structure. LocalStorage updated to `TASK_BREAKER_STORAGE_KEY_SUBTASKS_v2` due to structure change.
- **PriorityGrid Tool Enhancements (Phase 1 - UI/UX & Basic Presets)**:
    - Updated `PriorityTask` interface to include optional `frequency`, `specificDate`, `specificTime`.
    - Enhanced the "Add Task" form with inputs for these new properties (Select for frequency, Popover Calendar for date, input type="time" for time).
    - **UI Clarity**:
        - Added asterisk `*` for required fields in "Add Task" and "Edit Task".
        - Implemented collapsible "Options avancées" section for frequency, date, and time in both "Add Task" and "Edit Task" forms to reduce initial clutter.
        - Added `Tooltip` components to clarify the purpose of quadrants and other input fields.
    - Implemented an "Edit Task" dialog to modify all task properties.
    - Task cards in the grid now display frequency, date, and time if set.
    - All task data, including new properties, is saved to/loaded from `localStorage` (using key `PRIORITY_GRID_STORAGE_KEY_TASKS_v1`).
    - Implemented a functional **Preset System**:
        - "Charger un Preset" button opens a dialog.
        - Dialog lists hardcoded, categorized presets using an Accordion for a tree-like structure.
        - Selecting a preset populates the "Add Task" form, expanding advanced options if needed.
        - Toast notification confirms preset loading.
        - Added more preset categories and items.
- **PriorityGrid Tool Enhancements (Phase 1.5 - Custom Presets)**:
    - Added "Sauvegarder comme Preset" button to save current task form details as a custom preset.
    - Custom presets are named by the user via a dialog.
    - Custom presets are saved to/loaded from `localStorage` (using key `PRIORITY_GRID_CUSTOM_PRESETS_KEY_v1`).
    - Custom presets are displayed in the "Charger un Preset" dialog under a "Mes Presets Personnalisés" category.
- **Database Integration Planning (Phase 0 Started)**:
    - Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` library.
    - Added placeholder `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to `.env`.
    - Added a placeholder "Hors ligne / Online" toggle button to the header (shows a toast).
- **Database Integration (Phase 0 Continued)**:
    - Removed "Outils (Lampe)" and "Étincelles" navigation buttons from header.
    - Updated `.env` with actual Supabase project URL and anon key.
    - Created `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` to initialize and export the Supabase client.
    - Provided `supabase_schema.sql` for user to set up tables (brain_dumps, routines, routine_steps, task_breaker_tasks, priority_tasks) and RLS policies in their Supabase project.
    - User executed `supabase_schema.sql` in their Supabase project.
- **Database Integration (Phase 1: User Authentication)**:
    - Implemented Sign Up (`/auth/signup/page.tsx`) and Log In (`/auth/login/page.tsx`) pages with UI logic using ShadCN components, react-hook-form, Zod, and Supabase client methods.
    - Created `AuthContext` (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) for session management (listens to `onAuthStateChange` from Supabase). It also initializes `AppDataService` with user ID and manages a basic online/offline state.
    - Wrapped root layout in `AuthProvider`.
    - Updated `MagicHeader` (`src/components/common/magic-header.tsx`) to dynamically display:
        - "Connexion" and "Inscription" links when logged out.
        - User avatar (initials), email (desktop), and "Déconnexion" button when logged in.
        - Loading skeletons during auth state determination.
    - The "Hors ligne / Online" button is now visually disabled if no user is logged in, and toggles a global state (though full sync logic is pending).
- **Database Integration (Phase 2: Abstract Data Layer & Services - Started)**:
    - Installed `dexie` library for IndexedDB management.
    - Updated `src/types/index.ts` with comprehensive data models including `id`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` and DTOs for creation.
    - Defined service interfaces in `src/services/interfaces/` (`IService.ts`, `IPriorityTaskService.ts`, etc.).
    - Created `src/services/indexeddb/db.ts` to set up Dexie database schema ("EasyGenieDB_v1").
    - Implemented `PriorityTaskIndexedDBService` (`src/services/indexeddb/priority-task.indexeddb.service.ts`).
    - Implemented `PriorityTaskSupabaseService` (`src/services/supabase/priority-task.supabase.service.ts`).
    - Created initial structure for `AppDataService` (`src/services/appDataService.ts`) to orchestrate data operations, with placeholder online/offline logic and user ID management.
    - `AuthContext` now initializes `AppDataService` with `userId` and a basic online/offline state toggle.

## To Do

- **Database & Sync Implementation (High Priority)**:
    - **Phase 2: Abstract Data Layer & Services (Continue)**
        - Implement IndexedDB and Supabase service providers for `RoutineService`, `BrainDumpService`, `TaskBreakerService`.
        - Refine `AppDataService` to correctly use these services and manage the online/offline mode (currently a basic toggle).
    - **Phase 3: Integrate PriorityGrid with New Data Layer**
        - Refactor `PriorityGridTool` to use `AppDataService` instead of `localStorage`.
        - Make "Hors ligne / Online" toggle fully functional within PriorityGrid, influencing `AppDataService` mode and data source.
    - **Phase 4: Synchronization Logic**
        - Implement logic for tracking local changes (dirty checking or pending sync log in IndexedDB).
        - Implement initial sync (login/switch to online): upload local, download remote, conflict resolution (e.g., last write wins based on `updated_at`).
        - Implement ongoing sync: attempt Supabase write first; if fails, queue locally.
        - Implement offline-to-online sync: process queue, fetch remote changes, resolve conflicts.
    - **Phase 5: Integrate Other Tools** (TaskBreaker, RoutineBuilder, BrainDump) with `AppDataService`.
    - **Phase 6: UI Feedback & Error Handling** for sync status, online/offline mode, and errors.
- **PriorityGrid Tool Enhancements (Post-Database)**:
    - Implement a full client-side recurrence engine (managing completion cycles, auto-generating next instances for daily, weekly tasks etc.).
    - Integrate voice input for adding/editing tasks in PriorityGrid.
    - Explore AI assistance for quadrant suggestion based on task text and intensity.
- **TaskBreaker Tool Enhancements**:
    - Consider voice input for adding/editing individual sub-tasks (currently only for main task).
    - Refine UI for very deep nesting if it becomes an issue.
- **RoutineBuilder Tool Enhancements (Phase 2)**:
    - Consider UI for reordering routines and steps.
    - Optional: Add specific time input for routines.
    *   Optional: Interactive execution mode (checking off steps as done for a specific day).
    - Refine voice input for editing existing step text (currently only appends).
- Integrate Genkit AI more deeply into other existing tools (TimeFocus modes) to make the "magic level" (intensity) impact their behavior.
- Implement remaining tools from `tool-grid.tsx` with their specific functionalities and intensity level integrations:
    - DecisionHelper (placeholder page exists)
    - MoodTracker (placeholder page exists)
    - FocusMode (placeholder page exists)
- Flesh out "Étincelles" (Sparks) page content.
- Implement actual email sending for contact form.
- Refine UI/UX across all tools, including responsive design, accessibility, loading states, and error handling for new features.
- Add relevant image placeholders with `data-ai-hint` to all newly developed tool pages where appropriate.
- Add tests (unit, integration).
- Review and improve safety settings for Genkit flows.
- **Voice Input**: Refine voice input for BrainDump, Formalizer. Fully implement for new tools where applicable.
- **User Profile**: Consider a dedicated user profile page for managing account details (e.g., password change, profile picture if Supabase Storage is used).
- **Email Confirmation**: Ensure "Confirm email" is enabled in Supabase project settings for production.
- **Password Reset**: Implement a "Forgot Password" flow using Supabase's `sendPasswordResetEmail` and a page to handle the password update.
