## To Do

- Integrate Genkit AI more deeply into existing tools (TaskBreaker suggestions, BrainDump analysis, etc.) to make the "magic level" (intensity) impact their behavior.
- Implement remaining tools from `tool-grid.tsx` with their specific functionalities and intensity level integrations:
    - RoutineBuilder (placeholder page exists)
    - DecisionHelper (placeholder page exists)
    - MoodTracker (placeholder page exists)
    - FocusMode (placeholder page exists)
- Add user authentication (e.g., Firebase Auth).
- Flesh out "Ã‰tincelles" (Sparks) page content.
- Implement actual email sending for contact form.
- Refine UI/UX across all tools, including responsive design, accessibility, loading states, and error handling.
- Add relevant image placeholders with `data-ai-hint` to all newly developed tool pages where appropriate.
- Store tool data for authenticated users (e.g., using Firestore).
- Add tests (unit, integration).
- Review and improve safety settings for Genkit flows.
